# Github_Map_Closing_Notes

### My development environment remote information for a project
remote origin commit information can be found in the linked issue:
<br>https://github.com/Swuber/unf-swuber_web_app_phoenix/issues/4

### Check out the first time I needed to use SVN instead of git.
neat way I get a part of a repository without the whole enchillada:

### Cherrypicking
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9339429/what-does-cherry-picking-a-commit-with-git-mean
1) Make sure you are on the branch you want apply the commit to.
 ```git checkout master```
2) Execute the following:
 ```git cherry-pick <commit-hash>```

```git notes copy <fromcommithash> <tocommithash>```

simplify into single command: 
git checkout branch; git cherry-pick <commit-hash>git notes copy <fromcommithash> <tocommithash> 
### how github handles repo names
```
github allows [A-Za-z0-9_.-], and transforms all other characters to "-"
when we were getting each file name
we needed to check immediately if it passed and ignore/not create repo if it failed.
```

### when rebasing a large number of commits (implemented in next header)
```
if squashing make changes on a seperate branch
then, do not merge; 
instead preserve the old copy of master renaming
and then change the rebased branch to master
(implemented in next header: how to change master branch)
```
### how to change master branch
```
git branch -m master old-master
git branch -m seotweaks master
git push -f origin master
git push origin master:master --force
```

```
If you want to rename the current branch, you can do:

git branch -m newname
```
